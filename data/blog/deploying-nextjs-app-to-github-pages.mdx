Not long ago I made the decision to start sharing my dev experiences in a blog, and why not starting by describing the steps I took to get a Next.js app (_This Blog_) deployed to GitHub Pages.  


The app I am using is a stater template cloned from [Vercel templates](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog). 

  

## Create a repository 
 

1. First, start by creating a **public** repository in GitHub using the following naming convention _\<github_username\>.github.io_. The repository name must start with your username to work.

2. Clone the repository using your git client of preference.

3. Create or add your existing Next.js app to the repository. In my case, I cloned the starter template from [Vercel templates](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/tailwind-css-starter-blog) and updated the code to my taste.

4. Ensure your app is running locally.  

This app uses _yarn package manager_, so I ran the following command to test it works in the browser. 


``` script 

yarn dev 

```

5. Once tested, commit and push your changes to GitHub

## Configure Pages 


1. In GitHub, go to the _\<github_username\>.github.io_ repository and navigate to _Settings > Pages_.

2. Under Build and deployment section, click on the Source dropdown and choose GitHub _Actions_.

3. A new GitHub workflow will display underneath. Click on _Configure_ button

4. This workflow will run every time a commit is made to the *main* branch, building and deploying your app as soon as it happens.  

Save workflow by clicking on _Commit Changes_ button.

5. Add your commit message and click on _Commit Changes_

6. Navigate to _Actions_ tab and check the deployment progress.

7. Once deployment is complete, you can navigate to the URL provided in the _deploy_ job.

8. And this is it! You have a Next.js app running in GitHub Pages
