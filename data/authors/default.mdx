👋 I’m a software engineer eager to learn something new every day. 

When I’m not writing code or experimenting with emerging tools, you’ll usually find me pushing my limits in triathlons. 
Training for swimming, cycling, and running helps me stay focused, disciplined, and constantly learning much like software development. 
The balance between technical problem solving and physical challenge keeps me grounded and motivates me to keep improving both as a developer and as an athlete.

Few years ago, I had the idea to start a personal blog where I could share what I’ve learnt, 
help other developers who might run into the same challenges I faced, and suggest custom implementations to improve performance and overall experience.

As a native Spanish speaker, I know firsthand how much easier it is to research and learn in your own language, 
especially when you’re still building up your English skills. I noticed that gap and wanted to make things more accessible for developers 
who might benefit from content in Spanish and better understand what I’m trying to share.

The posts on this blog are available in both English and Spanish. Feel free to switch to whichever language you find most comfortable.

I hope you enjoy the content and find something that inspires, helps, or sparks your curiosity.
